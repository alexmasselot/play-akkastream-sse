server sent events with Play
============================

Launch the code:

    ./activator ~run

This project expose 2 type of ways to generate SSE:

 * *WORKS" `http://locahost:9000/ticks` shoots texts via `Source.tick`
 * *FAILS* `http://localhost:9000/actor-flow` shoots two messages via a akkastream Source.actorRef

*Problem* : The second method sees the messages going through the akkastream flow but are not sent through the http channel...

 All the code is in `app/controllers/StreamController`
